### bouncing_ball_game
* A simple game where you move the paddle by using either keys or your cursur not to let the ball touch the floor. 
* You can customize the background pictures just by saving your favorite image files as `img1.png`, `img2.png` and so on. 
* Open weather information API is used, and it notifies you the real-time weather information of Tokyo if you win the game.
